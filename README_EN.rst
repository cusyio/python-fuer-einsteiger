Python for Beginners
====================

Outcome
-------

After this course you will write simple programs in the Python
programming language on your own and execute them.

Target Audience
---------------

People with little or no previous knowledge of programming who would
like to use Python to automate repetitive tasks and work together with
experienced developers more smoothly.

Prerequisites
-------------

none

Course Description
------------------

Everybody can program! The aim of this course is to introduce people
with little or no previous experience in programming to the Python
language. By solving many bite-size programming tasks, you will become
familiar with new commands one after the other. In the end, you will
achieve basic literacy in a programming language that you can apply
yourself comfortably, or take the next learning steps on your own. This
course does not spend much time on theory but is meant to keep you
writing code most of the time.

Course Duration
